//! Turning a keypress into a named action.

/// A key as the table stores it: the code, and the two modifiers that carry
/// meaning.
///
/// `SHIFT` is deliberately absent. In the legacy key-reporting mode — which is
/// the only mode recon runs in, because it never pushes the keyboard
/// enhancement flags — crossterm attaches `SHIFT` exactly when the character
/// is uppercase (`char_code_to_event` in crossterm's unix parser). So for a
/// letter the modifier repeats what the `char` already says, and for
/// punctuation it is never set at all: `{` is not "shifted `[`" as far as the
/// terminal is concerned, it is the character `{`.
///
/// Keeping it would mean every table entry had to guess which of the two
/// spellings a terminal would send. That guess is what #250 was: `G` arrived
/// carrying `SHIFT`, failed an `is_empty()` guard written for keys that never
/// carry it, and fell through to a handler that answered the wrong question.
